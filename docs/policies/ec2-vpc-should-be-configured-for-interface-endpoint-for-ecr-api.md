## Description

DISCLAIMER - This policy works when all resources of type aws_vpc and aws_vpc_endpoint are present in the root module.

This control checks whether a virtual private cloud (VPC) that you manage has an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon ECR API. The control fails if the VPC doesn't have an interface VPC endpoint for ECR API. This control evaluates resources in a single account.

AWS PrivateLink enables customers to access services hosted on AWS in a highly available and scalable manner, while keeping all the network traffic within the AWS network. Service users can privately access services powered by PrivateLink from their VPC or their on-premises, without using public IPs, and without requiring traffic to traverse across the internet.

This rule is covered by the [ec2-vpc-should-be-configured-for-interface-endpoint](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-FSBP-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/ec2/ec2-vpc-should-be-configured-for-interface-endpoint.sentinel) policy.

## Policy Results (Pass)

```bash
trace:
        Pass - ec2-vpc-should-be-configured-for-interface-endpoint-for-ecr-api.sentinel

        Description:
        This policy requires resources of type `aws_vpc_endpoint` should have
        'vpc_endpoint_type' configured with interface endpoint and should be
        referenced to `aws_vpc` resource.

        Print messages:

        → → Overall Result: true

        This result means that all resources have passed the policy check for the policy ec2-vpc-should-be-configured-for-interface-endpoint.

        ✓ Found 0 resource violations
