# AWS RDS cluster snapshots and database snapshots should be encrypted at rest

## Description

Encrypting data at rest reduces the risk that an unauthenticated user gets access to data that is stored on disk.
Data in RDS snapshots should be encrypted at rest for an added layer of security.

This control checks whether an RDS DB snapshot is encrypted. The control fails if an RDS DB snapshot isn't encrypted.

This rule is covered by the [rds-encryption-at-rest-enabled](../../policies/rds-encryption-at-rest-enabled.sentinel) policy.
