## Description

DISCLAIMER - This policy works when all resources of type aws_ebs_volume and aws_volume_attachment are present in the root module.

This control checks whether the EBS volumes that are in an attached state are encrypted. To pass this check, EBS volumes must be in use and encrypted. If the EBS volume is not attached, then it is not subject to this check.

For an added layer of security of your sensitive data in EBS volumes, you should enable EBS encryption at rest. Amazon EBS encryption offers a straightforward encryption solution for your EBS resources that doesn't require you to build, maintain, and secure your own key management infrastructure. It uses KMS keys when creating encrypted volumes and snapshots.

This rule is covered by the [ec2-attached-ebs-volumes-encrypted-at-rest](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-FSBP-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/ec2/ec2-attached-ebs-volumes-encrypted-at-rest.sentinel) policy.
