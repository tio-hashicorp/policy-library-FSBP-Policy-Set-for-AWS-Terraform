Encrypted is set to false in the DescribeFileSystems response.

This rule is covered by the [efs-file-systems-should-be-encrypted-at-rest](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-FSBP-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/efs/efs-file-systems-should-be-encrypted-at-rest.sentinel) policy.

## Policy Results (Pass)

```bash
trace:
        Pass - efs-file-systems-should-be-encrypted-at-rest.sentinel

        Description:
        This policy requires resources of type `aws_efs_file_system` should have
        'encrypted' set to true and 'kms_key_id' should not be empty.

        Print messages:

        efs_encrypted_values:  {"constant_value": true}
        efs_kms_key_id_values:  {"constant_value": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/example-key-id"}
        → → Overall Result: true

        This result means that all resources have passed the policy check for the policy efs-file-systems-should-be-encrypted-at-rest.
