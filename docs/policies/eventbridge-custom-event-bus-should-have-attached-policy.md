## Description

This control checks if an Amazon EventBridge custom event bus has a resource-based policy attached. This control fails if the custom event bus doesn't have a resource-based policy.

By default, an EventBridge custom event bus doesn't have a resource-based policy attached. This allows principals in the account to access the event bus. By attaching a resource-based policy to the event bus, you can limit access to the event bus to specified accounts, as well as intentionally grant access to entities in another account.

This rule is covered by the [eventbridge-custom-event-bus-should-have-attached-policy](../../policies/eventbridge-custom-event-bus-should-have-attached-policy.sentinel) policy.

## Policy Results (Pass)

```bash
trace:
        Pass - eventbridge-custom-event-bus-should-have-attached-policy.sentinel

        Description:
        This policy requires `aws_cloudwatch_event_bus` resources to be attached to a
        policy.

        Print messages:

        → → Overall Result: true

        This result means that all resources have passed the policy check for the policy eventbridge-custom-event-bus-should-have-attached-policy.
