## Description
This control checks whether CloudTrail is configured to use the server-side encryption (SSE) AWS KMS key encryption. The control fails if the KmsKeyId isn't defined.

For an added layer of security for your sensitive CloudTrail log files, you should use [server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html) for your CloudTrail log files for encryption at rest. Note that by default, the log files delivered by CloudTrail to your buckets are encrypted by [Amazon server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html).
This rule is covered by the [cloudtrail-server-side-encryption-enabled](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-FSBP-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/cloudtrail/cloudtrail-server-side-encryption-enabled.sentinel) policy.
