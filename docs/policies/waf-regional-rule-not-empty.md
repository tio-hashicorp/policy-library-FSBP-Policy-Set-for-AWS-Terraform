## Description

This control checks whether an AWS WAF Regional rule has at least one condition. The control fails if no conditions are present within a rule.

A WAF Regional rule can contain multiple conditions. The rule's conditions allow for traffic inspection and take a defined action (allow, block, or count). Without any conditions, the traffic passes without inspection. A WAF Regional rule with no conditions, but with a name or tag suggesting allow, block, or count, could lead to the wrong assumption that one of those actions is occurring.

This rule is covered by the [waf-regional-rule-not-empty](../../policies/waf/waf-regional-rule-not-empty.sentinel) policy.
