## Description

DISCLAIMER - This policy works when all resources of type aws_network_acl and aws_network_acl_rule have their `cidr_block` or `ipv6_cidr_block`
attributes set as a constant value.

This control checks whether a network access control list (NACL) allows unrestricted access to the default TCP ports for SSH/RDP ingress traffic. The rule fails if a NACL inbound entry allows a source CIDR block of '0.0.0.0/0' or '::/0' for TCP ports 22 or 3389.

Access to remote server administration ports, such as port 22 (SSH) and port 3389 (RDP), should not be publicly accessible, as this may allow unintended access to resources within your VPC

This rule is covered by the [ec2-network-acl](../../policies/ec2/ec2-network-acl.sentinel) policy.
