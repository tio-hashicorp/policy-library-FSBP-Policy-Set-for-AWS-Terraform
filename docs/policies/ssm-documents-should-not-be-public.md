## Description

This control checks whether AWS Systems Manager documents that are owned by the account are public. This control fails if Systems Manager documents with the owner Self are public.

Systems Manager documents that are public might allow unintended access to your documents. A public Systems Manager document can expose valuable information about your account, resources, and internal processes.

This rule is covered by the [ssm-documents-should-not-be-public](../../policies/ssm-documents-should-not-be-public.sentinel) policy.
