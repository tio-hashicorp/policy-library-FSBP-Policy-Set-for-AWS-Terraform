## Description

DISCLAIMER - This policy works when all resources of type aws_cloudfront_distribution and aws_s3_bucket are present in the root module.

This control checks whether Amazon CloudFront distributions are pointing to non-existent Amazon S3 origins. The control fails for a CloudFront distribution if the origin is configured to point to a non-existent bucket. This control only applies to CloudFront distributions where an S3 bucket without static website hosting is the S3 origin.

When a CloudFront distribution in your account is configured to point to a non-existent bucket, a malicious third party can create the referenced bucket and serve their own content through your distribution. We recommend checking all origins regardless of routing behavior to ensure that your distributions are pointing to appropriate origins.

This rule is covered by the [cloudfront-s3-origin-non-existent-bucket](../../policies/cloudfront/cloudfront-s3-origin-non-existent-bucket.sentinel) policy.
