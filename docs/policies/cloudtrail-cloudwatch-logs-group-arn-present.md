# Cloudtrail Cloudwatch Logs Group Arn is set

## Description

This control checks whether CloudTrail trails are configured to send logs to CloudWatch Logs. The control fails if the CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn property of the trail is empty.

CloudTrail uses Amazon S3 for log file storage and delivery. You can capture CloudTrail logs in a specified S3 bucket for long-term analysis. To perform real-time analysis, you can configure CloudTrail to send logs to CloudWatch Logs.

For a trail that is enabled in all Regions in an account, CloudTrail sends log files from all of those Regions to a CloudWatch Logs log group.

This rule is covered by the [cloudtrail-cloudwatch-logs-group-arn-present](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-FSBP-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/cloudtrail/cloudtrail-cloudwatch-logs-group-arn-present.sentinel) policy.
