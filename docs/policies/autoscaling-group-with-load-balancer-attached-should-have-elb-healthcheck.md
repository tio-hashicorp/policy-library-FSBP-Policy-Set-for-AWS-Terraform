## Description

DISCLAIMER - This policy works when all resources of type aws_autoscaling_group and aws_autoscaling_attachment are present in the root module.

This control checks whether an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group that is associated with a load balancer uses Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) health checks. The control fails if the Auto Scaling group doesn't use ELB health checks.

ELB health checks help ensure that an Auto Scaling group can determine an instance's health based on additional tests provided by the load balancer. Using Elastic Load Balancing health checks also helps support the availability of applications that use EC2 Auto Scaling groups.

This rule is covered by the [autoscaling-group-with-load-balancer-attached-should-have-elb-healthcheck](../../policies/autoscaling-group/autoscaling-group-with-load-balancer-attached-should-have-elb-healthcheck.sentinel) policy.
