# Lambda function policies should prohibit public access

## Description

This control checks whether the Lambda function resource-based policy prohibits public access outside of your account. The control fails if public access is permitted. The control also fails if a Lambda function is invoked from Amazon S3, and the policy doesn't include a condition to limit public access, such as AWS:SourceAccount. We recommend using other S3 conditions along with AWS:SourceAccount in your bucket policy for more refined access.

The Lambda function should not be publicly accessible, as this may allow unintended access to your function code.

This rule is covered by the [lambda-function-public-access-prohibited](../../policies/lambda/lambda-function-public-access-prohibited.sentinel) policy.
