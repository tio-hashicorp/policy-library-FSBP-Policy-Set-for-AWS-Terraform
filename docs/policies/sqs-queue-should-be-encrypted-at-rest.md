## Description

DISCLAIMER - This policy works when all resources of type aws_sqs_queue are present in the root module.

This control checks whether an Amazon SQS queue is encrypted at rest. The control fails if the queue isn't encrypted with an SQS-managed key (SSE-SQS) or an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key (SSE-KMS).

Encrypting data at rest reduces the risk of an unauthorized user accessing data stored on disk. Server-side encryption (SSE) protects the contents of messages in SQS queues using SQS-managed encryption keys (SSE-SQS) or AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS).

This rule is covered by the [sqs-queue-should-be-encrypted-at-rest](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-FSBP-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/sqs-queue-should-be-encrypted-at-rest.sentinel) policy.
