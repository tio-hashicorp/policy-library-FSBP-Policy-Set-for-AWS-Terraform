## Description

This control checks whether an AWS WAF global rule contains any conditions. The control fails if no conditions are present within a rule.

A WAF global rule can contain multiple conditions. A rule's conditions allow for traffic inspection and take a defined action (allow, block, or count). Without any conditions, the traffic passes without inspection. A WAF global rule with no conditions, but with a name or tag suggesting allow, block, or count, could lead to the wrong assumption that one of those actions is occurring.

This rule is covered by the [waf-global-rule-not-empty](../../policies/waf-global-rule-not-empty.sentinel) policy.

## Policy Results (Pass)
```bash
trace:
      Pass - waf-global-rule-not-empty.sentinel

      Description:
        This policy requires resources of type `aws_waf_rule` to have at least one
        predicate.

      Print messages:

      → → Overall Result: true

      This result means that all resources have passed the policy check for the policy waf-global-rule-not-empty.

      ✓ Found 0 resource violations
