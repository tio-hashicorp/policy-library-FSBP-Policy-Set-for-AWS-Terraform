## Description

DISCLAIMER - This policy works when all resources of type aws_cloudfront_distribution and aws_wafv2_web_acl are present in the root module.

This control checks whether CloudFront distributions are associated with either AWS WAF Classic or AWS WAF web ACLs. The control fails if the distribution is not associated with a web ACL.

AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect web applications and APIs from attacks. It allows you to configure a set of rules, called a web access control list (web ACL), that allow, block, or count web requests based on customizable web security rules and conditions that you define. Ensure your CloudFront distribution is associated with an AWS WAF web ACL to help protect it from malicious attacks.

This rule is covered by the [cloudfront-associated-with-waf](../../policies/cloudfront/cloudfront-associated-with-waf.sentinel) policy.
